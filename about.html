    <h3>About</h3>
    <p style="width: 60%;">Studio Ghibli movies and the adorable characters have captured people's hearts from all over the world.Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 in Tokyo by the three men, <strong>Takahata, Toshio Suzuki</strong> and the well-known film
    producer <strong>Hayao Miyazaki</strong>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The name Studio Ghibli was based on the Arabic name for <em>"hot sahara wind"</em> because the founders
    wanted Studio Ghibli to blow new wind through the anime industry. At the same time Ghibli was also the name of an
    Italian war plane and therefore it also represented Hayao Miyazaki's love for planes and for Italy.Before Miyazaki
    worked for Ghibli he had already directed a few films like Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro and Future Boy
    Conan. The first original movie directed by Miyazaki was Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind in 1984. Some people argue
    that it's not a real Ghibli production because the movie was released a year earlier than the official formation of
    Studio Ghibli. The official first Ghibli movie was Laputa: Castle in the Sky.</p>
